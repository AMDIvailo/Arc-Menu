# ![Arc Menu](https://github.com/LinxGem33/Arc-Menu/blob/master/screenshots/aam.resized.png?raw=true) Arc Menu

Arc menu is a Gnome shell extension designed to replace the standard menu found in Gnome 3 this menu is based on the zorin os menu, some of the added benefits of the Arc Menu extension is the long awaited search functionality as well as quick access to files on your system and also the current logged in user along with quick access to the software centre and system settings.

### What's next for Arc Menu?

My first initial priority was to get this extension stable enough to upload to extensions.gnome.org as this was a menu baked into the Zorin OS operating system so it had to be ported to work with the gnome shell eco system, once I've ironed out the bugs which appear after this first release i can then move onto stage two which is to start adding new features.
